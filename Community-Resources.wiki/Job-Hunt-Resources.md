Landing your first job in tech isn't easy, but we have tips and tricks to share to make the whole process a lot smoother.

## Resume Rewrite  
You'll want to structure your resume to focus on what you **want** to do, while highlighting your transferable skills. When describing your work experience, focus on accomplishments rather than job duties, to show employers where you excel and thrive.

● What made me really great at my job?  


### Resume Rewrite Tips   
● Add a technical skill summary to the very top of your resume   
● Include completed training, and remember to update as you keep learning
● List your technical projects   
○ Include your WatchUs.dev projects  
○ This may include open source contributions or contributions at hackathons   
● Let hiring managers know where to find you, by including links to your GitHub, LinkedIn, and/or personal portfolio


● Search through target job descriptions for key non-technical skills   
○ Problem-solving, communication, time management, process improvement
● Think of previous accomplishments that showcase these skills
● Remove any “job duty” bullets and replace with accomplishments, including key words
○ An accomplishment is anytime you MADE, SAVED or ACHIEVED something
○ Format the statements as VERB + CONTEXT + IMPACT
○ List in present tense for current positions and past tense for past positions
○ Remove fillers like “Responsible for” and start with an action verb


● Use simple and consistent fonts and styling throughout
● Keep it to 1-2 pages and remember to leave white space (1⁄2 inch - 1 inch margins)
● Spell check and get another set of eyes on it
● Save a PDF to send to hiring managers and recruiters to retain formatting


Accomplishments vs. Responsibilities
There is more to any career than just the technical skill. You’re likely bringing to the table industry knowledge coupled with professional experiences that hiring managers want to see.

Read through job descriptions that match positions you are seeking. Look for repeating nontechnical skills and start making a list. Common skills would include: problem-solving, time management, resource management, project management, increasing efficiency, automating tasks, etc.

Once your list is created, highlight the skills you both possess and wish to use in your next position. Focus on how those items relate skills that you will continue to leverage in your next position.

 These are your transferable skills. Hiring managers will know your job duties based on your title. Do not waste resume real estate by stating the obvious; instead show how you stand out. Look at the two lists below and compare.
Example Bullets for Responsibilities:
● Coordinated artist press releases
● Managed customer mailing list
● Handled photo and press releases to media outlets
● Assisted in radio copywriting
● Performed various other duties as assigned

Example Bullets for Accomplishments:
● Coordinated 8 artist press releases that contributed to an increase in annual sales by 14%
● Compiled and maintained a mailing list of 12,000 customers, the art center’s largest ever
● Organized photos and press releases to CNS Television and Yorkville Daily News
● Collaborated on a team of 3 editors on the copywriting and promotional radio commercials for 16 events

Look through your previous employment and think of some key accomplishments (MADE, SAVED, or ACHIEVED something) you obtained using these transferable skills. If you can include any metrics, your accomplishments will be even more powerful (numbers, percentages, etc.). A recruiter can assume what your job duties were based on your title, so reiterating those duties is a waste of real estate. Instead show them not just what you did, but what you did WELL.

Notice how the accomplishment was pulled out of this experience:  

Rough Notes: On my first day on the job as an Administrative Assistant, I couldn’t find anything, because the filing system was a mess. Customers were unhappy, because wait times were long as we located files. I reorganized the filing system, which now works beautifully.

Accomplishment Statement: Improved office efficiency and customer service by overhauling previously haphazard filing system.

Remember the format: Verb + Context + Impact

Resume Templates

Make sure your resume reflects the type of work you want to be doing. If you want design to be an aspect of your career, then use a unique design to stand out and show off those skills. Graphics can help convey a message, just don’t get too carried away.

And what about cover letters? Just like your resume, you'll want to focus more on what you want to be doing than what you have been doing, while emphasizing your new tech skills and transferable skills.

## Leveraging LinkedIn
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) is a great tool to use in your job hunt. By optimizing your profile, you'll show up in more searches by recruiters and hiring managers, positioning yourself as a star candidate. If you already have a LinkedIn profile created--that's great! Build off what you have, and use your headline, summary, skills, and projects sections to highlight why you'll be great in a tech role.

__Leveraging LinkedIn Tips__  

First Impressions  
    A (professional) headshot makes you 14x more likely to be viewed   
    Create a powerful headline to stand out in search results  
    Craft your summary as a mini elevator pitch (focus on what you want to be doing)
    Highlight transferable skills in your work experience
    Showcase projects so hiring managers can see your work
    List relevant certifications
    Gather recommendations from colleagues that highlight transferable skills
    Tailor your list of skills so your endorsements reflect technical and transferable skills

Join the Community
    Follow companies and influencers of interest to you   
    Join relevant groups and jump into the conversation   
    Share targeted information on a regular basis

Resources
    Have a few companies of interest on your target list? Use LinkedIn to see who you might know on the inside and possibly ask for a referral. Use this format to “make the ask” for an initial meeting if you are reaching out to a 2nd or 3rd degree connection.
    Made it to the interview stage? Do some research on who you will meet with so you can quickly build rapport. Being able to highlight similarities (without sounding like a stalker) can really help you stand out. Research will let you know if you would fit the team and will allow you to tailor your elevator pitch.
Gaining Visibility  
    98% of recruiters and 85% of hiring managers are on LinkedIn
    If you use the appropriate keywords and brand yourself well, they may reach out to you for positions without you even applying.
    When you submit your resume in the traditional manner, you could be resume 85 out of 100. HR might identify the 10 they wish to interview before getting halfway through the stack, meaning you never get a glance. But, when you are selected by the recruiter based on your profile you move up to the top of the stack.

LinkedIn Profile Review
    Complete your profile - Follow LinkedIn’s suggestions and aim for “All Star” status
    Capture your likeness - Use a clean headshot with a white background. Use a recent picture.
    Craft an interesting headline - LinkedIn will default to your current job title as your headline. This is a missed opportunity for you. Take advantage of this special space (which is what shows up next to your name and picture in search results). Use your headline to showcase something unique you bring to the table and make it target the type of position you are trying to land.  
    Customize your URL - A line of gibberish after your backslash isn’t going to do you any favors. Having a clean link on your resume and other key spots makes it easier to share. Keep it simple and professional.  
    Choose your words wisely - Research job descriptions for positions you are targeting and pick out common keywords and phrases to sprinkle into your profile.  
    Create a proper summary - Use this section to point out what you are bringing to the table, with the end goal of your targeted position in mind. Aim for about three succinct paragraphs; bullet points are welcome. Walk recruiters and hiring managers through your skills, passions and unique qualifications. Show why you are special, and focus on what you WANT to do. Tell your story.
    Chart your path - Show your accomplishments through metrics. As you list your career history, showcase one to two times where you made, helped or achieved something while in that role.  
    Captivate your audience - Add presentations, videos and links to projects you have worked on that support your professional goals. A link to your GitHub and portfolio is mandatory. Showcase what you can do. These additions will capture the attention of recruiters as well.
    Cite your references - Recommendations will take you much further than endorsements. Think back to those accomplishments and ask a colleague (current or former) to write a recommendation for you based on that experience. Have a plan in place to highlight key skills.
    Clean up your endorsements - Make sure your endorsements focus on the skills you wish to highlight, especially if you are making a career transition. Drop outdated skills from your profile, and add new ones as you pick them up. When a recruiter sees your profile, you want them to notice the most relevant skills.

Cultivate your network - Now that your profile has completed its makeover, it’s time to start leveraging LinkedIn. Remember, this is a professional networking site so stay on target with your branding and message. And don’t just be a taker, you need to give back to make these relationships successful.  
    Connections, connections, connections - Start out small and shoot for 100 professional connections.  Keep growing and aim for 500+. You want recruiters to see that you are a part of the community.
    Choose a group - Have an interest? LinkedIn has a group for it. Seek out groups that are relevant to your chosen field and industry and join the conversation. This is a great way to build your reputation.  
    Companies of interest - Everyone has a wishlist of companies they would love to work for. Follow them on LinkedIn so you’re in the know as they make announcements and share information.
    Communicate regularly - Status updates are just as important here as on any other social networking site, but keep the message professional. Aim for one to three updates a week. Not sure what to say? Share an article of interest to you.
    Contribute your thoughts - Consider becoming an author and publish your professional perspective through LinkedIn. If you already have a blog, add the link to your profile and share new posts that are relevant and professional.


## Impressive Interviewing
Interviewing is an intimidating process, but we have some curated advice to help you not only get through the interviewing process, but to excel at it!

## Projects & Portfolios
The word "portfolio” gets thrown around a lot, but what does it really mean?

The perfect portfolio displays the skills you want to get hired for, and your GitHub profile can serve as your portfolio. Continue to make commits even after graduation; employers want to know you have a passion for tech beyond the 12-week course.

You can also make a custom website to showcase your skills and projects. If you’re more interested in a design path, be sure to have a portfolio to share of your design work.

Not every project has to be a perfect, complete piece of work, either. Employers want to know that you’re curious, a problem solver, and open to learning.

## Where are grads finding these jobs?
Networking is one of the best ways to find a job. Plan to attend tech events as part of your weekly (or monthly) routine, and start to form real relationships with others in the local tech community.  

LinkedIn has a jobs portal, and you can customize your interests to receive more tailored listings.  

Recruiters can serve as a great resource during the job hunt.  

Sites like [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/), [ZipRecruiter](https://www.ziprecruiter.com/), provide listings for thousands of jobs. You can set personalized alerts using keywords for jobs you’re interested in to help cut out some of the clutter.  

## Keys to Success  
1. create multiple projects to showcase your skills
2. continue learning and developing  
4. contribute to open source projects- we have a ton :)  
3. become active parts of the community
