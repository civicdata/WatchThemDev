#  Before you begin  
:rainbow: Ohai and Welcome to __WatchUs.Dev__, a community-focused, community-powered, FREE online software/portfolio building &  learning group.  

This effort was inspired the early model for :sparkling_heart: [__Code Louisville__](https://codelouisville.org) which has since grown into college course offerings at JCTC.  If college is your jam, please do check them out!  

__WatchUs.Dev__ focuses on free software skillset growth, portfolio building, networking,  and community building. All our mentored sessions are online (no in-person sessions for the course work), so the only barrier to entry is internet access.  

AND FREE!
