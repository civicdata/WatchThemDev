The purpose of capstone projects is to reinforce what you’ve learned and to help build out your portfolio which will showcase your skillsets. Projects are one of the most powerful tools to leverage when meeting & interviewing with potential employers.  

Create a projects that demonstrate your knowledge of the front-end dev skills you’ve been working so hard to cultivate.  

Your project need not be “complete” in that it doesn’t need to be a fully-functioning, finalized project. It can be a small, simple site that only has a few features. It can even have incomplete features. Every dev knows that projects are never really finished, they are iterations/incarnations of ideas.  

What is valuable is being able to demonstrate to prospective employers and co-workers best practices, while showcasing your ability to problem-solve.

##  Suggestions:  
The below items are the criteria suggestions for your personal project. Feel free to discuss your project/plan with mentors in advance  

### Criteria:  
* Your project should be responsive   
* Your project includes custom-written CSS selectors/rules in a .css file   
* Your project includes custom-written JavaScript includes JavaScript and/or jQuery function located in a .js file  
* Your code leverages comments   
* Your project is uploaded to your GitHub account, in its own repository, and the link to it is submitted to the slack chan   
* Please include a README file located at the root of your project that includes a description of your project and - if necessary - any special instructions to run/view your project     

##  FAQ  
### How projects are reviewed   
* The project reviewer will clone your project to their local machine and open index.html (or whatever your readme indicates)   
* Responsive design will be tested using browser dev tools, different devices, simulators and Browserstack to simulate one or more mobile and/or tablet devices  

###  Naming your project and files   
* Please use all lowercase, no spaces, only underscores or dashes for your naming convention   

###  Responsive Design   
* Your site/app must improve user experience with its responsive design, such as making the page easier to view or read, rearranging content, swapping in different assets, etc.    
__How to responsive design: __    
    * CSS media/device queries that change & adapt your pages to be fully legible and contained to differing screen and device sizes   
    * Using a framework (such as Bootstrap 4 or Bulma, etc) to implement responsive design    

### Custom CSS   
* These selectors/rules should be located in a separate .css file you created.  Please do not leverage inline CSS, as that is not best practice, nor scalable   
### Custom JavaScript   
* Include some form of JavaScript in a separate .js file in your project.  
* JavaScript frameworks are most welcome :)    

###  Comments 
* Please comment your code. You can read more about code commenting and some best practices here: https://dev.to/realedwintorres/why-code-comments-still-matter-1el0  
 https://dev.to/adammc331/todo-write-a-better-comment-4c8c  
* Emojis in code commenting are perfectly FINE: https://dev.to/fbnlsr/lets-talk-about-emojis-2788   

### Git and GitHub   
* It's a great idea to host your projects in additions to putting your code on GitHub for review  
* Check out GitHub pages (https://pages.github.com/) for a quick way to host your site. Digital Ocean is also awesome af   
* Git and GitHub skills are necessary. It’s how we find and view your projects, leveraging version control is a critical skillset that you must have to gain employment. 

### README File 
* Your readme should help a human understand what your project is going to do and the steps needed to get it running   
* If you require any special setup, installation, configuration, or other steps to view your project, please include those steps in your README   

### Testing Your Project  
You should test your project on as many devices as possible. Here are some tools that can help with that beyond your browser dev tools device settings:
https://www.browserstack.com/  
http://browsershots.org/  

### Mentors  
We want to hear all about your projects. Please do talk about your project early and often with the channel. Explain your idea and the features you are considering implementing. Rubber ducking often helps to solve problems more quickly, this includes problems with project architecture.
